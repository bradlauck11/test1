- PI: David Berkoff, MD

## Study Summary

- The purpose of this study is to see if a new experimental drug, called CNTX-6970, is safe and works for people with chronic pain from knee OA. In this study, we will be looking at two different doses of CNTX-6970, 100mg, and 300mg twice a day. The study is also using celecoxib 100mg, twice a day. Celecoxib is already approved by the FDA for knee OA pain. This study will compare the study drug to a placebo.
