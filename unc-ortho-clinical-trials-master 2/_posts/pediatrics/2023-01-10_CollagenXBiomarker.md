## Study Info
- IRB#: 19-1117
- PI: James Sanders, MD

## Study Summary
- The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy of Collagen X biomarker as a measure of growth activity and velocity compared to the current radiographic and anthropometric measures in children with idiopathic scoliosis

##  Inclusion Criteria
- Idiopathic scoliosis as defined by a current or previous COBB angle of at least 20 degrees
- Skeletally immature patients of both genders 7 years of age or greater, this will enable us to capture patients at all points of the growth curve (particularly those at onset and cessation of their growth spurt)
- Female patients should be premenarchal or less than 1.5 years postmenarchal
- Patients currently undergoing treatment with bracing will not be excluded

##  Exclusion Criteria
- No prior spine fusion
- No abnormalities of maturation or height
- No skeletal dysplasia or dwarfism

## Study Timeline
- Baseline: Consent, Anthropometric & Radiographic Measurements, Blood prick for baseline CXM Level
- 3 days in a single week for a period of 6 months, subject will perform a finger prick within 1 hour of waking up. Total of 18 Blood pricks.
- 6 months: Repeat Anthropometric and Radiographic Measurements, determine if skeletal maturity is reached

## Payment
- $10 after each 6-month period

## Study Cost Coverage
- No associated costs
