## Study Info
- IRB#: 21-0157
- PI: James Sanders, MD

## Study Summary
- The purpose of this study is to evaluate cardiopulmonary function and to develop new testing measures to test activity capacity in children with Early Onset Scoliosis. The maximum amount of air (forced vital capacity) that participants can forcefully exhale will be compared to the energy required to perform specific activities (Metabolic Equivalents). This is a pilot study which will enroll a total of 10 participants.

##  Inclusion Criteria
- Children ages 6 -18 years with early-onset scoliosis
idiopathic, syndrome, neuromuscular disease
- Any curve pattern including the thoracic or lumbar spine
- Spinal scoliosis radiographic imaging within 6 months of testing demonstrating scoliosis curve pattern and magnitude
- Parent able to communicate either in English or via translator

##  Exclusion Criteria
- Any known uncorrected cardiac disorder such as cardiac myopathy or congenital cardiac anomaly likely to effect cardiac output capacity.
- Inability to understand instructions for exercise or spirometry such as a child with severe autism or cognitive problems
- Respiratory Infection within 4 weeks

## Study Timeline
- One time 150 minute visit with spirometry and exercise tests

## Payment
- No payment associated

## Study Cost Coverage
- No associated costs
